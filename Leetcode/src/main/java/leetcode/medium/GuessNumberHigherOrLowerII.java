     * Basic idea,
     * if there are only two numbers in the range.
     * we always guess from the smaller one, we can guarantee that we spend smaller amount and guess right.
     * because if they pick the first one, we dont spend any, if they pick larger one, we spend smaller.
     * So dp[i][j] if i = j - 1, dp[i][j] = i; which is the smaller one.
     *
     * then we use dp.
     *ã€€
     * DP function is we pick k from i to j. then max = k + max(dp[i][k-1], dp[k+1][j]).
     * then we compare this with the global minimum, take the smaller one. set dp[i][j] = global minimum.
     * reset the global minimum before we start loop through i to j. before the k loop.
     * we need to find out each  i to j, the minimum cost of maximum cost.
     *
     * then we return dp[1][n]
